Here you'll find a collection of programming assignments to continue learning and practising:

1. [Java Collections][4]
2. [Object-Oriented Programming][5]
4. [Input and Output][6]


## :memo: Instructions

For code assignments, we've provided a starter Java project. 

Like you did when working on exercises:

- navigate to assignment's root folder, 
- then run the provide tests.

They should all fail at first - since there is no implementation for them yet. You will provide that implementation. :grin:

**<ins>Example</ins>**

To complete the Java Collections' assignment, navigate to the `collections` homework folder.

```shell
cd collections
```

Then run the tests. 

- If you're on a Linux, or Mac machine, run:

```shell
./mvnw clean test
```

- If you're on Windows, run this command instead:

```shell
mvnw.cmd clean test
```

**Happy practising! :smile:**
