## :memo: Instructions

Starting with unit 2, we've provided a starter Java project. 

To start working on a unit's exercises:
- navigate to that unit's root folder, 
- then run the provide tests.

They should all fail at first - since there is no implementation for them yet. You will provide that implementation. :grin:

**<ins>Example</ins>**

To complete the Java Primitive Types's exercises, navigate to the `java-primitives` folder.

```shell
cd java-primitives
```

Then run the tests. 

- If you're on a Linux, or Mac machine, run:

```shell
./mvnw clean test
```

- If you're on Windows, run this command instead:

```shell
mvnw.cmd clean test
```

**Happy learning! :smile:**
