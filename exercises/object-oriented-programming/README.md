The goal of these exercises is to practise OOP concepts:
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Abstraction

For the exercises below, we've provided the starter project above.

## :pushpin: Classes & Objects

### Part 1

Inside the `cars` package, create a class called `Car` with the following members:
- `private String make`
- `private String model`
- `private String colour`
- `private int year`
- `public Car(String make, String model, String colour, int year)` - constructor that accepts parameters representing the make, model, colour and year of the car
- `public String getMake()` - returns the car make
- `public String getModel()` - returns the car model
- `public int getYear()` - returns the year the car was made
- `public String getColour()` - returns the colour of the car
- `public String setColour()` - sets the colour of the car
- `public String getDetails()` - returns the car details, including the make, model, colour and year

#### :white_check_mark: Verify Your Implementation

To verify that your code works as expected, run the `CarTest` tests.

In your terminal, ensure that you are in the `object-oriented-programming` folder, then run the following command:

```shell
./mvnw clean test -Dtest=CarTest
```

If you are on Windows, run this command instead:

```bat
mvnw.cmd clean test -Dtest=CarTest
```

Your implementation is correct when all tests pass.

### Part 2

Create a class called `Showroom` with the following members:
- `public List<Car> getCars()` - returns a list containing the following three `Car` objects:
  - a blue Volvo V40 from 2012
  - a red Porsche Panamera from 2009
  - a grey Audi A3 from 2018

In the `main` method of the `App` class, instantiate a `Showroom` object, call `getCars()` and print the details for each `Car` instance in the list.

#### :white_check_mark: Verify Your Implementation

To verify that your code works as expected, run the `ShowroomTest` tests.

In your terminal, run the following command:

```shell
./mvnw clean test -Dtest=ShowroomTest
```

If you are on Windows, run this command instead:

```bat
mvnw.cmd clean test -Dtest=ShowroomTest
```

Your implementation is correct when all tests pass.

## :pushpin: Inheritance

### Part 1

Inside the `accounts` package, create a class called `Account` with the following members:
- `public Account(int accountNumber, double balance)` - constructor that accepts parameters representing the new account number and starting balance
- `public double getBalance()` - returns the current account balance
- `public int getAccountNumber()` - returns the account number
- `public double deposit(double amount)` - deposits funds to the account and returns the new balance
- `public double withdraw(double requested)` - withdraws funds from the account and returns the requested amount or `0` if the account has an insufficient balance

#### Notes
- This account doesn't have an overdraft facility.
- The balance of an account may only be modified through the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods.
- Consider the necessary instance variables and the appropriate access modifiers to allow any sub-classes to access those values

#### :white_check_mark: Verify Your Implementation

To verify that your code works as expected, run the `AccountTest` tests.

In your terminal, run the following command:

```shell
./mvnw clean test -Dtest=AccountTest
```

If you are on Windows, run this command instead:

```bat
mvnw.cmd clean test -Dtest=AccountTest
```

Your implementation is correct when all tests pass.

### Part 2

Using the `Account` class as a base class, create two derived classes:

`SavingsAccount` with the following members, in addition to the attributes of the `Account` class:
- `public SavingsAccount(int accountNumber, double balance, double interestRate)` - constructor that accepts parameters representing the new account number, starting balance and interest rate
- `public void applyInterest()` applies interest to the account
- `public double getInterestRate()` - returns the current interest rate
- `public void setInterestRate()` - sets the interest rate

`CurrentAccount` with the following members, in addition to the attributes of the `Account` class:
- `public CurrentAccount(int accountNumber, double balance, double overdraftLimit)` - constructor that accepts parameters representing the new account number, starting balance and overdraft limit
- `public double getOverdraftLimit()` - returns the current overdraft limit
- `public void setOverdraftLimit()` - sets the overdraft limit

#### Notes
Ensure that you have overridden methods of the `Account` class where necessary in the derived classes.

#### :white_check_mark: Verify Your Implementation

To verify that your code works as expected, run the `CurrentAccountTest` and `SavingsAccountTest` tests.

In your terminal, run the following command:

```shell
./mvnw clean test -Dtest=CurrentAccountTest,SavingsAccountTest
```

If you are on Windows, run this command instead:

```bat
mvnw.cmd clean test -Dtest=CurrentAccountTest,SavingsAccountTest
```

Your implementation is correct when all tests pass.

### Stretch Goal

If you have extra time in the session, or wish to experiment further, create a `Bank` class to manage accounts. Consider the following ideas — you may choose to implement some, all or come up with your own:
- storing a internal list of accounts. Remember that accounts in the list could be instances of the `Account` class, the `SavingsAccount` class, or the `CurrentAccount` class.
- opening a new account, given a type and balance.
- getting a list of account numbers held by the bank
- getting an account, given an account number
- closing an account, given an account number
- displaying a report of all accounts held by the bank
- paying a dividend to all accounts held by the bank
- applying interest to all savings accounts
- contacting all current account holders if their account is in overdraft.

Update `App.java` to create a bank instance and then execute your bank's operations

#### Notes
There are no tests for the `Bank` class, so it's up to you how to implement it.

## :pushpin: Abstraction

In this exercise you will develop a class hierarchy of shapes and write a program that computes the amount of paint needed to paint different objects. 
The hierarchy will consist of a parent class `Shape` with three derived classes - `Sphere`, `Rectangle`, and `Cylinder`.

For the purposes of this exercise, the only attribute a shape will have is a `name` and the method of interest will be one that computes the area of the shape (surface area in the case of three-dimensional shapes).

### Part 1

Inside the `shapes` package, create an abstract class `Shape` with the following members:
- `abstract double getArea()` - returns the area of the shape
- `String getName()` - returns the name of the shape

In the same package, create a concrete class `Sphere` that extends `Shape`:
- `Sphere(double radius)` - constructor
- `double getArea()` - overrides the base method. The value is given by the formula (`4` * `𝛑` * (`radius`<sup>2</sup>))

In the same package, create a concrete class `Rectangle` that extends `Shape`:
- `Rectangle(double length, double width)` - constructor
- `double getArea()` - overrides the base method. The value is given by the formula (`length` * `width`)

In the same package, create a concrete class `Cylinder` that extends `Shape`:
- `Cylinder(double radius, double height)` - constructor
- `double getArea()` - overrides the base method. The value is given by the formula (`height` * `𝛑` * (`radius`<sup>2</sup>)).

#### Notes
Consider the appropriate visibility of all constructors, methods and instance variables

#### :white_check_mark: Verify Your Implementation

To verify that your code works as expected, run the `ShapeTest` tests.

In your terminal, run the following command:

```shell
./mvnw clean test -Dtest=ShapeTest
```

If you are on Windows, run this command instead:

```bat
mvnw.cmd clean test -Dtest=ShapeTest
```

Your implementation is correct when all tests pass.

### Part 2

Inside the `shapes` package, create a class `Paint` with the following members:
- `Paint(double coverage)` - constructor that accepts a parameter representing the number of square feet per gallon this paint can cover
- `getAmount(Shape shape)` - returns the amount of paint (measured in gallons) needed to paint a given shape

#### :white_check_mark: Verify Your Implementation

To verify that your code works as expected, run the `PaintTest` tests.

In your terminal, run the following command:

```shell
./mvnw clean test -Dtest=PaintTest
```

If you are on Windows, run this command instead:

```bat
mvnw.cmd clean test -Dtest=PaintTest
```

Your implementation is correct when all tests pass.

### Stretch Goal

If you have extra time in the session, or wish to experiment further, create a **program** in the same package that computes the amount of paint needed to paint various shapes, e.g.:
- a rectangular deck of length `35` and width `20` 
- a ball of radius `15`
- a tank of radius `10` and height `30`.

Consider the following ideas:
- print the amount of paint needed for each item
- print the overall amount of paint needed to the screen
